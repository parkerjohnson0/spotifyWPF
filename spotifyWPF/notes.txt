ISSUES
localhost redirection is annoying me. make some kinda actual page to show that it was successful?
viewmodels may have to pass data back and forth to cut down on API calls
    EG. NavVM makes call to get all playlists, parse and send api song list endpoint to RootVM whenever playlist link is clicked.
    
recreating friends list functionality
    endpoint for this data is only available through an undocumented endpoint. requires different token to access. 


how to get very different views to be displayed in the root panel
	have it contain just a base items control? that changes from styling? based off the underlying model type of the bound collection?


why is overriding the default scrollbar style so ridiculously annoying
	have to copy paste 150 lines from the default template. 
    
after a few days I have confirmed my biases against stackoverflow's dogmatic mvvm nerds

todo
selecting playlist should deselect other home/lib/search and vice versa
clean up some stuff from rootvm
give each vm authorized property which returns from static app.authorized
	not quite ready to work yet. property wont update 
make auth blur look better. add vignette to background
disable interaction with UI until authorized
use pkce auth flow. so that way token can be stored for longer. otherwise would have to refresh token every hour if access token not replace with refresh token. 

long term
	store a certain amout of playlists so api doesnt have to be called too much
	save to file. startup roottemplate should be last selected
	look into using more dependency properties
