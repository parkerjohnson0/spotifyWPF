ISSUES
localhost redirection is annoying me. make some kinda actual page to show that it was successful?
viewmodels may have to pass data back and forth to cut down on API calls
    EG. NavVM makes call to get all playlists, parse and send api song list endpoint to RootVM whenever playlist link is clicked.
    
recreating friends list functionality
    endpoint for this data is only available through an undocumented endpoint. requires different token to access. 

make auth blur look better. add vignette to background


why is overriding the default scrollbar style so ridiculously annoying
